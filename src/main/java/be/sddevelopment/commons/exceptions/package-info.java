/**
 * <p>
 * When working with external/JDK libraries, the checked exceptions they throw
 * sometimes prevent you from writing the code you want.
 * The most common strategies of dealing with unwanted checked exceptions are:
 * - ignoring them
 * - converting them to unchecked exceptions
 * - converting the return type to an Optional.empty()
 * - handling them with an alternative flow / logging
