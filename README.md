[![Quality Gate Status](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=justDoji_coding-utils&metric=alert_status)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=justDoji_coding-utils) ![Build](https://github.com/sddevelopment-be/coding-utils/workflows/Build/badge.svg?branch=main)

Generic utilities to promote a clean design of the code we write on a daily basis.

## Structure

The source code will contain the classes needed to simplify your code. If you are interested in
seeing them in action, take a look at the test cases for a certain utility. These will give you a
very concrete and runnable example of the utility class in action.

## Documentation

### JavaDoc for Library API

If you are wondering how you can use this project, you should do the old-school thing and RTFM (read
the flippin' manual).  
The code is documented using standard Java practices, meaning that the public facing APIs are
documented in JavaDoc. This JavaDoc is then processed through maven and hosted on a github-pages
webspace, which you can find here:
[deployed javadocs](https://sddevelopment-be.github.io/coding-utils/javadoc/). To learn more about
github-pages, take a look at the [github documentation](https://pages.github.com/).
