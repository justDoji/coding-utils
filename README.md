Generic utilities to promote a clean design of the code we write on a daily basis.

## Structure
The source code will contain the classes needed to simplify your code.
If you are interested in seeing them in action, take a look at the test cases for a certain utility.
These will give you a very concrete and runnable example of the utility class in action.


## Documentation
Take a look at the [javadocs](https://justdoji.github.io/coding-utils/), which are generated into the documentation directory
and deployed using github-pages.
